        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (2 pound) flat iron steak</li>
            <li>2 1/2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon chopped fresh parsley</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon chopped fresh rosemary</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon chopped fresh chives</li>
            <li>1/4 cup Cabernet Sauvignon (or other dry red wine)</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>3/4 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon dry mustard powder</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Cooking Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Place steak inside a large resealable bag. Stir olive oil, garlic, parsley, rosemary, chives, red wine, salt, pepper, and mustard powder together in a small bowl.</li>
            <li>Pour marinade over steak in the bag. Press out as much air as you can and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator for 2 to 3 hours.</li>
            <li>Heat a nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Sear and cook the steak in the hot skillet for 3 to 4 minutes on each side for medium rare, or to your desired degree of doneness. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 130 degrees F (54 degrees C) for medium rare.</li>
            <li>Discard the marinade. Allow the steaks to rest for about 5 minutes before serving.</li>
        </ol>
